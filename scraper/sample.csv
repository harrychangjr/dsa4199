They might not be from your faculty, but the insights provided should answer most of your questions. All the best for your application!\n\nP.S. You probably won’t like it, but I still like to be straightforward with you. Asking a question and waiting for an answer may seem to be the easiest way, but no one will spoon-feed you here. I answered it because I saw that no one had answered it after hours had passed.', ""Hi there, I'm also a Singaporean applicant with international qualification from NA (Canada), I took AP exams too so our situations should be similar. I applied last application season and I'm leaving for Singapore in a days, so I supposed I knew my stuff quite ok. The NUS site can be a little confusing.   \n\n\nRegarding your questions:  \n1. NS. I think there's a section indicating NS status in undergraduate applicant portal. \n\n2. AP Pre-requisites. AP Calculus BC is a must and two other AP of your own choice. You don't HAVE TO report your AP Score the time you applied (for instance, you're taking your AP Calc BC the upcoming May, you have the option to report such a score in July ish, they'd still accept you). I've heard about people with no APs getting in, but for my own case I did report my AP scores.   \n\n\nHope this can help! Good luck my oversea Singaporean buddy."", 'That is so very helpful! That was my exact question.. I will be taking AP calc BC after the application period and I was wondering if I could still score report afterwards. That was my biggest concern.\n\nThe other question I had was program prerequisites. It mentions on the website that most programs have AP prerequisites (like AP bio for medicine program, etc.). If Im applying to the college of arts and sciences, are there any prerequisites? I seem to be unable to find any information about this online.', ""For arts and sciences I think the general 3 APs are fine. I took 5 APs personally, but I don't recall Arts and Sciences having any prerequisites, I might be wrong on this one though."", 'One more thing-- If I report my AP Calculus BC exam score LATER, as I am taking it in July 2024, will I only be notified of my acceptance after I report the exam?\n\nOr, will it be a conditional thing.. like I am notified in May and am accepted CONTINGENT on passing the AP Calculus BC exam']","[1, 7, 2, 1, 1, 1]"

It should be step 1 and at the top.\n\nSecondly, within the coursereg point, as OP pointed out the different rounds are only 2 days long and it's not one long round that lasts the entire period. This is very salient information and it should be the first bullet point within the section, rather than the last. At least, it should come before the line on where the outcome is posted.\n\nThirdly, I have to agree that it's extremely stupid to place long ass links throughout the infographic that can't even be copied and pasted by the student. The simple way would be to use a link shortener or QR code. The slightly more advanced way which is how I've seen the NUS dining and shuttle bus people doing it, is to chop the infographic into different JPGs and each JPG links to the URL that's mentioned in it. A bit hard to explain but check out the CS News circulars. I'll be writing in to RO to suggest that.\n\nBasically, while the process of coursereg/modreg is indeed something that the student should take some responsibility for, this infographic isn't helping and does more harm than good"", ""Ok everyone, just saw the comments here, would like to clarify why I brought these up.\n\nFirst of all, fair enough that it was my fault for being overly busy with work before university starts, but I have no other ways as I was the sole breadwinner of my family. It's because of this, I had to miss all the orientation opportunities, hence I've no seniors to ask and the only way is I juggle work and preparation for uni. Imagine already tired from work by the time you come back, and still having to filter out so many emails in your student inbox.\n\nAnd it's because of this, I started to only skim through since majority doesn't apply to me. I got the CourseReg Round 0 notification in this infographics format and decided to research more about this whole system, but even their website is confusing. Like look at this, the old ModReg page is still live on their website???\n\nhttps://nus.edu.sg/coursereg/using_modreg_undergraduate.html\n\nhttps://www.nus.edu.sg/coursereg/using_coursereg_undergraduate.html\n\nI had to clarify with RO that Round 0 wasn't for freshmen, and was asked to wait for future rounds. Unfortunately, when they sent this infographics to everyone, I only took note of the dates in big and assumed that I can perform CourseReg Round 1 to 3 anytime between those dates. I was also confused why CourseReg is Step 1 and Academic Plan is Step 2, when Academic Plan dates clearly started first. Logically, they should have been swapped around.\n\nThe long links in the JPEG infographics with no hyperlinks didn't help me either. Had they at least have the decency to put in QR code or shortened links, it'll really help people in similar situations as me (those who's still in NS, I feel you).\n\nLastly, I'll leave this here for RO to see their failure in communicating clearly, even though I know no one here agrees with me. Thanks @throwaway_4071 for articulating my points clearly, I agree my post was phrased badly. Have a good rest this week everyone :)"", 'Yep, this. Looking at the other comments, I must have phrased my points badly to be misunderstood by everyone else, so thanks for articulating my points clearly!', ""Your post was neither articulated/phrased badly nor irrelevant. I completely relate to your frustration about the poor communication of information, especially given that you are a new freshie who happens to be tied down by work commitments. \n\nI think the main message that we are trying to drive across here is that, moving forward, being busy cannot and should not be used as an excuse for missing deadlines. Is RO at fault here for the infographic design? Yes. Could the disseminated information have been more aligned with differences in CourseReg timelines for freshies and non-freshies? Yes. But, is RO, or even NUS going to do anything about it? Probably not. As a Y4, I think I've seen that same infographic being used for many years.\n\nI respect your hustle as the sole breadwinner, but I just want to politely remind you that university life will not slow down for you to catch up regardless of how busy you get. Stay strong, freshie."", ""Thanks buddy for understanding my point. I do agree that being busy with other commitments should never be the excuse of missing such important exercise. I didn't miss the deadline fortunately because my friend reminded me about it thankfully. If not for him, I would have probably miss some rounds already.\n\nI just feel that the communication can be better for future batches of freshmen, so they don't have to suffer what we've went through. They too, deserve information to be correct in a way that is clear, since they have 0 connections to ask around.\n\nThose people that downvoted probably just likes to see people suffer I guess.

Transferring to D1 would take longer than A2, but if A2 is overcrowded, this way may be easier to get to school.\n\nD1 serves between COM3 and UTown, doesn't go KR MRT.\n\nAlso, small tip, if your MRT ride passes by Botanic Gardens, you can consider taking bus BTC (Timings: https://theisbman.home.blog/btc-bus-timings). The nearest stop to SoC along BTC route is BIZ2. Best to take when you're going home, as it goes directly out of NUS after BIZ2.\n\nIf taking BTC into SoC by any chance, remember to transfer at KR MRT to avoid spinning one big round in campus."", ""Also possible to get to COM from BIZ, just requires some walking and taking some stairs (around 10 mins).

From there, cross the road and wait at LT13 bus stop. You have both A1 (to COM2) and D1 (to COM3). Not a very long walk, high chance can catch the A1 you missed at the terminal.\n\nAs for whether is it advisable to come in from KR MRT, it really depends on where you live. If alighting MRT at Clementi sounds more convenient for you, then you can take either Bus 96/A or 183.\n\n96 will bring you to NUS IT (Opp CLB).

SEP/NOC,dodgeyburito,2023-08-04 19:00:47,"['Please ask your questions here, https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/110adr5/potential_applicants_questions_thread/ , thank you\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/nus) if you have any questions or concerns.*', ""NOC alumni here. Thought I'll shed some light on why NOC over SEP.\n\nEssentially NOC is an entrepreneurship programme, and less of an overseas exchange programme. I'll definitely only recommend this programme if you are interested in entrepreneurship and startups. The main idea of NOC is to allow you to immerse in another country's startup ecosystem by interning at startups and taking up entrepreneurship courses in the hope that you'll be influenced to maybe one day start your own startup/venture. \n\nAs to why NOC, I think I really valued the experience of working overseas (and so do potential employers) and broadening my world view beyond what I am comfortable with in Singapore. Singapore is a pretty safe place and a very comfortable one imo, to the point where I still feel risk-taking and starting your own venture or working at startups are kinda frowned upon. And I wanted to go somewhere else where it's different (I went Vietnam for context) and immerse more in the daily life in another country (which I feel working gives you a more accurate taste than studying). Entrepreneurship is also something I've been interested in - I really like the idea of solving problems in new, innovative ways and have been exposed to that through my various projects I've done in NUS.\n\nOn a more practical note, I've always wanted to work overseas as I feel that gives me a leverage when speaking to potential employers as not many people have the opportunity to work overseas. Furthermore, NOC is cost-neutral coz you get allowance and salary from internship and from the school so that also helps you defray the cost of living. \n\nI would like to add on that being on NOC also allowed me time to travel around, but more so during the weekends. If work is flexible, I've seen my batchmates fly to other parts of the country and do remote working while spending some time travelling as well. \n\nCheers! Hope this helps!"", '1) this question is up to the individual! I chose japan because i could learn and practice a new language, i am kind of a weeb and i have already been to europe a few times and am bored of cathedrals and european food. Each coutnry/continent has its pros and cons so up to you what you want! Anyways when you apply you will put 5 choices so you may not even get your first choice. Just keep an open mind and shortlust a few choices.\n\n2) if u dont choose a difficult/hardcore uni like berkely, munich, ETH, KTH, then SEP = holiday. Just enjoy the free SU and vacation. NOC more for overseas internship experience, what is it like to work in an overseas company, networking etc. You choose a county fr SEP u can experience mixing w locals, what the daily life is like, can explore more areas in the country compared to being a tourist\n\n3) i never study. but thats bc japan uni is damn chill.

In EC1101E there wont be much of that anyway (except some calculus).\n\nFor EC2104, you would need to revise on your H2 math content (particularly pure math). There will be a bit of revision, but they will build on it. Topics covered include unconstrained and constrainted optimisation (Lagrangian multipliers, Kuhn-Tucker conditions etc), linear algebra (up to eigenvalues/eigenvectors & solving linear system of equations), multivariate calculus. This mod is pretty important as the content props up everywhere in 2k/3k/4k mods, especially the optimisation part. Its good to take this mod early (when I was a freshman, I was advised to take it in Y1S1 which is what I did but im from the pre-CHS batch, so idk if that advice still makes sense now).\n\nEC2303 is just statistics, its to establish solid foundations for the Econometrics modules series, EC3303, EC3304, EC4303, EC4305 (and EC4304 & EC4308 as well as other 4k mods that use Econometrics heavily as well as honors thesis).\n\nFor EC2101/2102, you would need to brush up on things like constrainted optimisation (Lagrangian multipliers) which would have been covered in 2104. EC3101/3102 get more mathematical, because they introduce game theory and infinite horizon models (so you need to solve for the equilibrium or steady state etc). They also start weaning you off graphs around that point iirc (but its also partly because it becomes increasingly impractical). Thats where the ability to visualise the mathematics in the head really helps ig. [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown/playlists) was very useful in helping me visualise the math behind Econs, like the various calculus related topics, linear algebra and stat topics, I recommend.\n\nIf you plan to walk the Quantitative Economics route, I strongly encourage taking EC3314 (Mathematics for Economics). That mod builds on 2104, and covers important topics like differential equations, partial differentials, difference equations, more optimisation, advanced linear algebra and real analysis in general (which becomes pretty important in Quant mods like 4301 and 4302 as well as grad Econs modules 5101R, 5102R, 5103R etc as well as Quant related work outside of school).\n\nI cant advise much on the math in policy Econs mods, I havent taken much. I'd assume they will use some optimisation and econometrics. As for Banking & Finance mods, ive read a review that said that EC4333 uses stochastic calculus.\n\nEdit: I found this [resource helpful for Quant Econs](https://python.quantecon.org/intro.html) (especially for practicing some of the math and some python). It also got me hooked onto the quant path in the first place lol. Heres the [intro lecture series](https://intro.quantecon.org/intro.html)."", ""The introductory course EC1101E (Introduction to Economic Analysis) will cover certain fundamentals and concepts that you may have learnt from JC Econs albeit from a more mathematical perspective. Even so, the math introduced into the course is relatively manageable (simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and at the very worse, simple differentiation) so don't worry too much if you forgot your basics as the course is designed in a way such that students with no prior Economics knowledge could also grasp the concepts well. Personally for me, I only took H1 Econs in JC but yet found the course relatively manageable. On the other hand, EC2104 and EC2303 will run through the fundamental mathematical and statistical concepts you will use for higher level economics courses respectively. \n\nI would not say there is much preparation per se, apart from putting in consistent effort and due diligence for the course (i.e. attending lectures and putting in effort for tutorial questions prior to tutorial lessons). Even though my math was rusty to the point that I even differentiated d/dx (e\\^x) as xe\\^x during the actual midterm for EC2104, I still did well for the course overall. Of course, if you are now brushing up on your math and econs knowledge prior to the start of the sem that will probably help slightly, but honestly to me it wouldn't make much of a difference.\n\nMost importantly, enjoy the content covered in the respective economics courses you are taking, and naturally you will find yourself doing well in them. All the best, and if you do end up in the same tutorial that I may be taking for EC1101E as a TA do be more active in class! :D"", 'ah the NS brain rot \n\njokes aside, your intro econs mods (1k and 2k) wont really need super complex math. just know how to press your calculator can alrd. basic calculus is good, knowing how to differentiate is enough for ec1101e, for ec2k youll need stuff like lagrangian/lagrange multipliers, partial differentiation, but dw itll be taught in the mod itself if u dk. \n\nif u can rmb some of ur jc econs, good. just forget the part about writing essays. youll revisit your jc econs concepts in ec1101e anyway, so nothing to be worried about. \n\nperhaps dig up your jc econs notes and go thru them again as a sort of refresher. look at the reviews on nusmods for the syllabus for whats covered, there should be plenty of reviews (i know i submitted one hehe) \n\nmidterms and finals are not hard in terms of difficulty, they\'re usually hard in terms of tediousness and completing the paper in time. generally everyone does kinda crap on the papers but econs dept bell curves pretty well id say. \n\nfor me i didnt take jc econs but didnt find it too hard to keep up with ec1101e, did pretty good for the mod also. for the ec 2k mods, do NOT take ec2101 and ec2102 in the same sem unless u really wanna die. my advise for ec in general is to be consistent, and also really understand the concepts, the midterms and finals are all about ""ok how fast can u see what calculation u need to do"" so if u know what needs to be done it\'s alot easier. lastly, the pace of learning in nus is ALOT faster than in jc so yknow prepare ur mental for that yes.\n\nall the best!']","[1, 11, 7, 6]"

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/nus) if you have any questions or concerns.*', ""Since the CS1010 mods preclude each other I doubt anyone can compare them perfectly. CS1010 is in C which is far less forgiving than Python (which 1010E is taught in). You will spend a lot of time dealing with memory violations and reading confusing error messages from the compiler. \n\nThis makes the practical exam (PE) difficult because you get 0 marks if your code doesn't compile (at least when I took the module). The PE environment is terrible - you have to connect to the NUS servers via a terminal and you can only use vim and command line tools like gdb and valgrind to debug your program like it's 1990. Since you're connecting to their servers you have to use the default vim configuration (or make quick changes yourself while the exam is running), so no plugins to help you with syntax highlighting and stuff. It's timed and proctored of course. All of this combined with the fact that you are likely new to programming means the average PE score is low.\n\nI'm not sure what the PE environment for CS1010E is but the language is more forgiving and it's easier to write a program that works and runs. It might not solve the question correctly if your approach is wrong, but it's better than getting a 0 for not compiling.\n\nI did feel like CS1010 questions were not super complex. It might be because the language is hard to use, so the questions might have been made easier to compensate. Every PE usually has 2-3 'easy' questions that you can solve if you know the material and don't make any syntax errors or memory bugs. The last question is difficult and most students don't manage to complete it, but you can get the bulk of your marks by securing the easy questions.\n\nI don't think C is a complex language - it's honestly pretty simple because it lacks a lot of features that python has by default. It's just unforgiving. And the additional features that python has make your life easier once you learn to use them.\n\nSince CS1010E is in python I expect the questions to be conceptually more challenging. You'll have to ask someone who took it.\n\nI think CS1010 is a really good foundation if you want to do other programming mods, because learning C is (imo) more beneficial as a first language than learning python. It forces you to learn how things work under the hood while python hides most of it. Moving from C to python is easier than python to C. If you don't care about programming and you're just taking this mod because it's required, CS1010E might be better. Python is useful in all fields nowadays while C is more niche.\n\nBTW I did badly in CS1010 and S/U'd it but I still think it was a useful mod and I don't regret taking it."", ""https://nus-cs1010.github.io/2223-s1/index.html\nCan read the materials and see how.\n\nWorkload wise: 8 Programming Assignments: 30% Final Assessment: 25%  Midterm Assessment: 10% Practical Exam 1: 10%  Practical Exam 2: 15%\n\ncs1010 uses C as the programming language, which some think is harder for beginners compared to Python in cs1010e.\ncs1010 teaches a lot of c features such as memory allocation, pointers, array, structure, etc while cs1010e teaches Python features such as dictionary, lamda, oop, etc.\n\ncs1010 programming environment is vim + github, which also gives beginners a headache.

They are often reserved for PRs (like me) and contrary to belief, citizens automatically receive MOE TG. The only reason PRs and foreigners need to apply is the terms and conditions of getting the MOE TG.\n\nUnlike citizens, PRs and foreigners are obligated to work in Singapore for at least three years to fulfill the bond requirements. So, if you don't already know, just note that getting the MOE TG means you need to secure a job here in Singapore. Failure to fulfill the bond means you need to repay the grant. \n\nIf MOE TG is not available, your only other option is to secure scholarships or finding a bank in your home country that offers tuition loans.

However, I would assume that in the case of international students, since the bond requires you to work 3 years in a Singapore entity (any company that is physically based in Singapore), and the fact that you\'ll then have to secure a work visa after graduation to fulfill said obligation, I guess the rejection rate stems from here (I am PR and by no means an expert in how MOE allocates their TGs) since unlike citizens and PRs who can defer the bond obligation indefinitely for reasons such as ""not finding employment"", your case would be more complicated since you can\'t stay in Singapore for long (I think) once your study visa expires and that would mean you\'ll need to search for a job here while out of country. \n\nPerhaps, the industry your course leans to might play a role in MOE\'s decision since smaller industries ""might"" affect your ability to find a job in Singapore before or upon graduation. Although, these are just some speculations of mine but depending on your own circumstance, you might be better able to guage the probability of your application being approved or rejected. Anyway, TG doesn\'t fully cover fees too so if you do get your TG, you\'ll still need another form of financial aid to cover the balance - unless you have the money to cover the semester fees.', 'Problem is OP is a foreigner.

However, OP can\'t stay in Singapore for long since study visa will be expired, work pass will take time to process, or finances might be an issue (rent/accommodation isn\'t cheap especially if you have no income to alleviate the burden). \n\nUnless MOE has revised the grant bond obligations, one simply can\'t waive the bond because if you could, who\'s not gonna take advantage of it by free-riding on the basis of ""I can\'t find work and stay in SG so I\'ll waive my bond"". Now, you can fork out $100,000+ to pay off the grant but if so, why bother applying in the first place?', 'All the best OP.
